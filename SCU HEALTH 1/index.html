							<h3>Occupational Medicine</h3>
							<p>Tactical Sportnel syndrome as it does for a deputy sheriff or a firefighter who have very physically demanding jobs with inherent risk and dangerous conditions.  s Medicine is  such as the military, law enforcement, fire fighters and emergency medical technicians.  Simply stated, this population is one of first responders.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="hero-area-theme3">
							<h3>Sports Medicine</h3>
							<p>Sports medicine has to perform at a faster speed of delivery of care, provide a more accurate diagnosis sooner, and design a management plan for “return to play” to the field, track, rink or other surface.  This sports medicine model of care is applicable to the tactical population as there is need for speed of care and rapid “return to play”/return to work management.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="hero-area-theme4">
							<h3>Tactical Strength Training & Conditioning</h3>
							<p>Tactical Strength and Conditioning is a branch of strength and conditioning, which focuses on the needs of the tactical population.  Each population has unique needs of performance.   Military personnel may have to carry heavy loads, which have increased over the decades.  Law enforcement carries a smaller load, but cannot take it off or put it down during their work shifts as the military is able to do.  Firefighters can carry significant loads onto unstable surfaces with limited vision due to smoke.  Emergency medical technicians often have low back   Preparing to enter these fields, or returning to work after an injury requires special attention to preparedness for the tasks involved.</p>

						<h3>Background</h3>
						<p>The birth rate has been steadily declining since 1990.  The available target population to enter law enforcement, firefighting and the military is becoming smaller.  Simply noted, there are fewer people to recruit.  Concurrently, this same population is less active and is in poorer condition than previous generations.  This has created a problem for all of the tactical environments.  </p>
						<p>The military has spent tens of millions of dollars on HPO to learn how to avoid inducing injuries as there is not a sufficient population to simply replace the injured recruit.  Training methods have been studied and subsequently modified.  The provision of musculoskeletal healthcare in the military is changing as well and is following a model closer to a sports medicine model.
							Some fire departments have hired a certified athletic trainer to manage minor injuries and the result has been fewer injuries and claims.  Australian police departments studied the impact that having department health clinics with a rapid response of care would have.  Injuries were reduced and officers were returned to work faster.  The financial impact was so significant that the government now helps fund these department clinics.
						</p>
						<p>There are law enforcement agencies in which the deputies/officers have to work 6-8 overtime shifts per month to fill the department employee deficits.  The solution to this volume of overtime work it is to reduce injuries in training, and to resolve the injuries of incumbent deputies/officers in a more efficient and timely manner.</p>
